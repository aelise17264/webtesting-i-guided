# Hubs Web API

Guided project for **Web Testing I** module.

In this module we will cover the basics of automated testing and use `jest` to write unit tests.

## Project Setup

- [ ] fork and clone this repository.
- [ ] **CD into the folder** where you cloned **your fork**.

Please follow along as the instructor uses _Test Driven Development (TDD)_ to implement the `add()` feature of a simple `calculator`.

## What to test?
- low hanging fruit: easiest possible test to write, the most obvious
- happy path: given the perfect input, does it work as expected
- edge cases: given wrong input, does it work as expected

## UserStory

`As a ____, I want ____, so that ____ : role, feature, value`

## Scenarios
